## What is a plant

A `plant` is an organism that wants to spread. It spreads by oozing outward in all
directions, creating near-replicas of itself. A plant's replica will share the
parent plant's `DNA`, but have a different `expression`. If multiple plants come
into contact they will merge into a new plant with the combined DNA
of the original plants. A plant has an expiration date after which it dies.
